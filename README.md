* Join the repository [here](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/).
* Inspired by the University of Alberta [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns).

## Micro Task Management Language (MTML)

* Generalized task management notation.

* Symbols:

    Symbol | Meaning
    --- | ---
    ! | Important
    \+ | Task
    \- | Metadata/elaboration on previous line
    ~ | Thought/idea
    ~~ | Thought/idea in flow
    \~~~ | Thought/idea in multi-day flow
    % | Edge/trading idea
    ? | Question
    @ | Topic, can be nested (useful in the calendar)
    $ | Performance related task/idea
    ^ | Test
    & | Refactoring
    \# | Bug
    <> | Think about it / sleep on it, a coda in blocks
    . | Relevant to this particular day (usually in the calendar)

* Blocks:
  * Symbols can be combined with other symbols.
  * Small topic is either one line or condensed multiple lines.
  * Big topic is surrounded by @ symbols and contains small topics.
  * Code blocks/comments appear verbatim without any symbols.
  * When in flow, elaboration hyphens can be omitted.

* Examples:
    ```
    !+ this is an important task
    - with some metadata here

    $& this is a performance related refactoring

    @ this is a big topic
    ~ with some ideas

    @ sub topic
    ~ with some ideas (related to the super topic)

    + tasks

    # bugs

    ? questions

    .^ and some tests to be performed today 
    @ this is a big topic (same text as in the first symbol)
    ```
